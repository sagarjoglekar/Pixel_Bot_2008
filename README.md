MATLab scrip repository of the code that drove our color based segregation robot. The code primarily summarises the algorithms that made decisions regarding bots orientation and motion after analysing the over head camera images .
The code will primarily run in Windows, as the camera control and acquisition is being done using Windows API, but you are free to change it to as it suits you. I will be more than happy to help in case of any issues.
